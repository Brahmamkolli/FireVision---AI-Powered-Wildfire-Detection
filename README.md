# FireVision - AI-Powered Wildfire Detection

## 🔥 Project Overview
Wildfires pose a major threat to ecosystems, human life, and property. **FireVision** is an AI-powered system designed to detect wildfires from image data using deep learning and computer vision techniques.  
This project aims to provide early detection, which can help in preventing large-scale destruction.

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset contains wildfire and non-wildfire images.  
- Preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation were applied.  
- The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets for model evaluation.

## ⚙️ Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/FireVision.git
cd FireVision
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model:
```bash
jupyter notebook "FireVision - AI-Powered Wildfire Detection.ipynb"
```

## 🧠 Model Details
- CNN-based deep learning model for image classification.  
- Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Model trained on wildfire vs. non-wildfire images.

## 📊 Results
- High accuracy achieved on test images.  
- The model successfully distinguishes wildfire scenes from safe environments.  
- Visualization of predictions and confusion matrix included in the notebook.

## 🔮 Future Work
- Improve dataset size and diversity.  
- Experiment with transfer learning (ResNet, EfficientNet).  
- Deploy as a real-time wildfire detection system with IoT/camera feeds.
